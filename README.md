To clone and start...
====================

First of all you need to have TWRP recovery source synced and device tree as well. If so, type the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hejsekvojtech/twrp_build_script <folder where TWRP source is synced>
cd <folder where TWRP source is synced>
```

Now type `nano build.sh` and set your device model and TWRP version.
And then type the last command:

```sh
bash build.sh
```
