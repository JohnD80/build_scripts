To clone and start...
====================

First of all you need to have TWRP recovery source synced. If so, clone this repository and copy build.sh file to the root folder of
TWRP source you synced before.

Now type `nano build.sh` and set your device model, brand, device tree repository and TWRP version.
And then type the last command to run it:

```sh
bash build.sh
```
